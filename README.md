# Mailbox System (MBS)

## Description

This project implements a mailbox system in C that enables communication between multiple entities via a central server. Senders transmit messages to the server, which stores them in mailboxes associated with receivers. Receivers can then retrieve messages from their mailboxes.

## Features

- **Sender** : Sends messages to the server to be stored in a specific mailbox.
- **Receiver** : Retrieves messages from a mailbox via the server.
- **Server** : Manages connections from senders and receivers, and stores messages in mailboxes.
- **Mailbox Management** : Implementation of a linked list data structure to manage mailboxes and messages.
